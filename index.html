      <h2>What is a Rhythm Game?</h2>
      <p>A rhythm game is a type of video game where players interact with the game by following a rhythm, usually in the form of musical cues. The primary gameplay mechanic involves timing actions, such as pressing buttons, tapping a screen, or using motion controls, to match the beats, notes, or sequences displayed on the screen. Successful timing and accuracy in matching these cues result in higher scores, while poor timing can lead to lower scores or even failure of the game session.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Rhythm games require players to follow musical cues and time their actions accurately to match the beats, notes, or sequences displayed on the screen. These games utilize various input methods, such as buttons, touchscreens, dance mats, or motion controls. Success in rhythm games depends on precise timing and coordination, and they often feature levels of increasing difficulty with a variety of musical genres.</p>
      <h3>Examples of Rhythm Games:</h3>
        <p>Dance Dance Revolution (DDR): Players step on a dance pad in sync with arrows on the screen that match the beat of the music.</p>
        <p>Guitar Hero: Players use a guitar-shaped controller to hit notes that correspond to the musical tracks.</p>
        <p>Osu!: A game where players use a mouse or touchscreen to click on circles in time with the music.</p>
        <p>Beat Saber: Players use virtual reality controllers to slice through blocks that appear in time with the music.</p>
        <p>Taiko no Tatsujin: A drumming game where players hit a drum in rhythm with on-screen notes.</p>
      <h2>What is Taiko no Tatsujin?</h2>
        <p>Before going any further, I should explain what exactly we're working with here. To make it easier to understand further along.</p>
        <p>This project centers around modding a rhythm game series called "Taiko no Tatsujin". A Japanese rhythm game featuring gameplay around hitting drums to the beat of the music.</p>
        <p>While it's rather niche internationally, recieving only a few international releases. It is an incredibly popular title in it's home country of Japan.</p>
        <p>This is a series that, because of it's incredibly easy to pick up but hard to master gameplay, it's a title that is not only popular with it's younger target demographic, but people of all ages too!</p>
        <p>Taiko no Tatsujin is notable for it's note types too. Unlike a lot of other rhythm games that typically like to focus on a 4 Key type of game play (DDR, StepMania, Project DIVA, etc.),</p>
        <p>Taiko only has 2 main note types. A red note, symbolising a "Don" sound, and a blue note, symbolising a "Ka" sound. Despite this, however, the game has a lot of rather complicated note patterns,</p>
        <p>which it's colourful demaner wouldn't lead you to believe.</p>    
        <p>Here are some images and gameplay examples of the game we're focusing on within this project.</p>
        <iframe id="video1" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f7Yimxud4UI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The video above is one of the most viewed videos on this game series on YouTube. Showcasing the song "MEGALOVANIA" from the popular 2015 indie title, "UNDERTALE"</p> 
        <p>This specifically is "Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum 'n' Fun" released for the Nintendo Switch in Japan and Asia on the 19th of July, 2018 and internationally on the 2nd of November, 2018.</p>

        <h2>What is Game Modding?</h2>
        <p>Game modding, or simply modding, is the process of modifying a video game to alter its content, gameplay, or features. This can be done by players or developers to enhance the game, fix bugs, add new features, or create entirely new experiences within the game. Here are the key aspects of game modding:</p>
      <h3>Types of Modding:</h3>
        <p>Cosmetic Mods: These mods change the visual aspects of a game, such as character skins, textures, and graphical enhancements.</p>
        <p>Gameplay Mods: These alter the mechanics or rules of the game, introducing new abilities, changing difficulty levels, or adding new missions and objectives.</p>
        <p>Content Mods: These add new content to the game, such as new characters, weapons, maps, or levels. (or, in our case, things such as custom songs).</p>
        <p>Utility Mods: These provide tools or features to improve the user experience, such as interface enhancements, performance optimizations, or debugging tools.</p>
      <h3>Popular examples of Game Mods:</h3>
        <p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: Known for its extensive modding community, with thousands of mods ranging from graphical improvements to new quests.</p>
        <p>Minecraft: Offers a vast array of mods that add new game mechanics, biomes, creatures, and more.</p>
        <p>Half-Life Series: The modding community for Half-Life and Half-Life 2 has created numerous total conversion mods, some of which have become standalone games.</p>
      <h3>Examples of Game Modding within other rhythm games:</h3>
        <iframe id="video2" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6A58noo7vk4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This is a custom model import into the rhythm game series "Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA Mega Mix+" released for PC back in 2022. Custom Model imports typically require the ability to rig models, to allow these otherwise foreign objects to function within the game. Usually tools such as Blender is used for this.</p>      
        <iframe id="video3" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4fTZt0q7zcI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This here is arguably a lot more basic, it's a mod for the Nintendo Switch rhythm game, "Groove Coaster Wai Wai Party", simply porting over songs from it's mobile release "GC2 Mobile" to the Switch release. Even simple tasks like these require a decent bit of work, whether that be converting audio formats, creating custom textures within the game or just making sure everything works.</p>
        <h3>Examples of Taiko no Tatsujin Modding:</h3>
        <p>UI Mods: Typically modifying the game to look like a different entry. Creating a UI Mod to make Drum 'n' Fun to look like Drum Session or Arcade.</p>
        <iframe id="video4" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HP5jc_6XJ6Y" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The video above is an example of UI mods within Taiko no Tatsujin games, in this case, it modified Taiko Drum 'n' Fun's UI to look similar to "Nijiiro" Ver's in-game UI.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Song Packs/Custom Songs: Large song packs exist to add additional content to the game, a popular example, ironically enough, would be the "Ultramix" created by myself and others for the PC Taiko no Tatsujin entry.</p>
        <iframe id="video5" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M6FkfHjiniE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>The video above, is the release video for the aformentioned Ultramix Song Pack, a mod that has had continuous work over the last 2 years.</p>
        <img src="assets/image5.png" style="width: 25vw; min-width: 100px;" />
        <p>And the example above is an example of a Song Pack which also modifies the GUI, worked on by myself, and two others.</p>
        <iframe id="video6" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/syidVH62GV4" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This here is an example of a custom texture addition, specifically in the game we'll be focusing on in our Final Major Project, adding the character "Peter Griffin" from Family Guy as an equippable accessory.</p>
        <iframe id="video7" width="560" height="315"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3zkVWzz7GE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This example here, adds a costume that's only usually accessible within certain parts of the game, and makes it usable throughout.</p>
      <h3>What is Game Patching?</h3>
        <p>Game executable (exe) patching refers to the process of modifying the executable file of a game to change or improve its functionality. This can involve fixing bugs, updating features, adding new content, improving performance, or even bypassing certain protections. </p>
        <p>Within the context of game modding, game executable (exe) patching involves modifying a game's executable file to enhance or change its functionality. This includes:</p>
        <p>Adding New Content: Modders can introduce new levels, characters, game modes, or other custom content that were not part of the original game.</p>
        <p>Tweaking Gameplay Mechanics: Modders can alter gameplay mechanics to create new experiences, such as changing the difficulty level, adding new abilities, or modifying game rules.</p>
        <p>Bug Fixes: The community often creates patches to fix bugs and issues that developers might not have addressed.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>Modding often involves the use of tools like hex editors, disassemblers, and specialized modding software. While modding can greatly enrich the gaming experience, it requires a good understanding of programming and the game’s structure. Additionally, modders should be cautious of security risks and respect legal boundaries, avoiding the creation or distribution of patches that facilitate piracy or violate the game’s terms of service.</p>

      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p>Development on the Video-based outcome to go here:</p>
      <h1>Technical Development</h1>
      <p>The Following, will document my technical development on this project. </p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>For starters, what exactly is it, I'm doing. Simply put, this is the more back-ended side of what I've been working on.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>This entire endeavor all started with what many things do, an idea. One that I decided to explore.</p>
      <p>I had though, is it possible to create a tool, a tool that could add more songs to my favourite entry in the series using Taiko's vast 20 year history of songs as a source.</p>
      <p>Surely enough, I was able to do that. And ended up going much further than that as well.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <h2>File formats and Technical Limitations</h3>
      <p>So, the main title we'll be focusing on here, will be "Taiko no Tatsujin: Drum Session" released for the Sony PlayStation 4 in Japan and</p> 
      <p>Asia on the 26th of October 2017 and internationally on the 2nd of November, 2018. And from here on out will simply be referred to as "Taiko PS4"</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>"fumen" chart files.</h3>
      <p>Fumen refers to the file format that Bandai Namco uses for their charts, this is a proprietary format, and is suported within all Taiko no Tatsujin games from the past 15 years!</p>
      <h3>Audio Formats, and such.</h3>
      <p>We'll be dealing with several audio formats here too, mainly for conversion.</p>
      <p>"nus3bank" refers to Bandai Namco's custom audio container for their games, these contain information such as the song's preview position in miliseconds, the file size of the audio format it uses, and the song name itself.</p>
      <p>I had created a tool specifically to convert standard audio such as "mp3", "flac" or "wav" to this format, more information on that in a bit as that project created slightly earlier in the month is going to be integrated into this one, as a rather crucial keystone for this whole operation to function.</p>
      <p>Other bits of audio information include the audio format the PlayStation 4 supports, in this case ATTRAC9, ".at9", which is a Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding, is a proprietary audio encoding format created by Sony themselves.</p>
      <p>Since the game we'll be focusing on is on a Sony console, the PlayStation 4, this is the audio format we'll be using along side the "nus3bank" contianer.</p>
      <p> </p>
      <p>Along with other modern Taiko entries, PS4 uses JSON files to store important information for the game.</p>
      <h3>But, what is a JSON file?</h3>
      <p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format commonly used for transmitting data between a server and a client. It's human-readable and straightforward for machines to parse. JSON is structured as key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces {}. Keys are strings followed by a colon : and corresponding values. Values can be strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, or null. For instance, a JSON snippet representing a person might look like this:</p>
      <img src="assets/jsonexample.png" style="width: 25vw; min-width: 100px;" />
      <p>In this example, "name" is a string key with the value "John Doe", "age" is a number key with the value 35, "isStudent" is a boolean key with the value false, "grades" is an array key with a list of numbers [85, 90, 88], "address" is an object key with nested key-value pairs defining an address, and "middleName" is a key with a null value. JSON is widely used in web development for APIs and data exchange due to its simplicity and compatibility across programming languages. To embed JSON data in an HTML document, you can use JavaScript to fetch JSON from a server or include it directly within a "<\script>" tag for processing and rendering dynamic content on web pages.</p>
      <h3>Taiko's "datatable" files.</h3>
      <p>Taiko PS4 stores all of it's json files in a little folder called "datatable". The two in particular we will be focusing on are "musicinfo" and "wordlist"</p>
      <p>The datatable file "musicinfo" stores specifically song data, including it'd uniqueId, which is an integer used namemly for things like score saving and such.</p>
      <p>Along with "starEasy", "starNormal", "starHard", "starMania", etc. which contain information on the song's difficulty level. Or things as simple as "id", which is just a 3-6 character string which every song in the game has, usually it's linked to the song name itself. For example, the Game Music song, MEGALOVANIA has an id which is "udtmgl". "udt" being shorthand for UNDERTALE, the game series in-which the song originates from, and "mgl" which is derrived from the song name itself, "MEGALOVANIA".</p>
      <p>There's also "wordlist", which, quite literally, holds the strings for every single text based item in the game. From UI text, to song names, it has it all, and in several languages too.
      <h3>Technical Limitations</h3>
      <p>Taiko PS4, unfortunately, has not one but two pretty significant limitations.</p>
      <p>The biggest, is it's "UniqueId" limit, the game, does not, allow for songs to go past 399. Meaning in layman's terms, you can't have more than 400 songs. (0 to 399). However, this is something we will be getting into later.</p>
      <p>And the other, each "datatable" file cannot be larger than 2.00 MB, why this is, who's to say. Our assumption is it's an arbitrary limitation set by NAMCO, because, who's going to try and add more songs?</p>
      <p>Luckily, at least, this one can be gotten around, "minifying" a JSON, which is essentially just the process of compressing it down to one line instead of "looking nice" at the cost of making it a lot harder to read, has the benefit of usually cutting down our limited file-size in half.</p>  
      <h2>The Fun begins</h3>
      <p>At first, as a rough draft, over 10 days ago, I created this:</p>
      <img src="assets/image1.png" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;" />
      <p>You'd be wondering, what exactly is this? Well before I wanted to fully commit to this, I wanted to know, can I at least parse the information I needed through a Python GUI.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, the answer to that, was, yes. What you see here, is an incredibly barebones program I put together, right now, all it does is read two files. "wordlist.json" and "musicinfo.json".</p>
      <p>Why such a basic test at first? Well, no JSON file is the same, and I had to see if I could read the data I needed in-line with how the game expects them formatted. And thankfully! I was able to.</p>
      <p>Then, the prototyping began, expanding from that very simple test, I started to add elements that showed me more information.</p>
      <img src="assets/image2.png" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;" />
      <p>What's shown here is an extension of that initial very simple test, however now it shows more information.</p>
      <p>Instead of just showing the Song Title, UniqueId and Genre, it now displays more information, including the Subtitle (if the song has one) or it's star rating (in order from Easy to Extreme).</p>
      <p>From there, however we were off to the races, more development took place on this GUI I was making, a tool to assist me in adding more songs over to this game.</p>
      <p>While there's no functionality yet, this was where my program began to take shape, where the idea for it to be able to export songs happened.</p>
      <img src="assets/image3.png" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;" />
      <p>And within less than an hour, things were starting to fall in place, having figured out how to actually order the GUI in a way I was actually happy with, as well. Not only that, verifying if the information being read, was correct.</p>
      <img src="assets/image4.png" style="width: 55vw; min-width: 330px;" />  
      <p>In the back, here, you can see the very beginning of our exporting tool in action. However, it was very very far from being done. As there's a lot more to adding files to this game then just modifying a few json files.</p>

      <h1>Production</h1>
    </div>  
    <div class="tab-content" id="tab5">
      <h1>Evaluation</h1>
        <p>Honestly, there's a lot to go over here. This project has taken me quite a while, and it's taught me a lot. From incredibly technical things, espcially within the realms of game modification, to improving my ability to create video content. Arguably, time management wasn't amazing throughout this, getting sidetracked onto the wrong things at the wrong times, but despite that, I've used this as an opportunity to learn, learn a lot more. When we initially started our Final Major Project earlier in the year, there was a lot I didn't know, and this has taken me on a journey that's improved my skills in various areas quite a lot. In this evaluation I'll delve deeper into that side of things, what I learned, both in the video production side of things as well as a lot of the technical skills I taught my self throughout this too...</p>
        <p> </p>
      <H2>Technical Skills.</H2>
        <p>During the course of this project, I went out of my way to learn a significant portion of things, especially with the coding language Python. Before, I could, at best, create a very simple "Hello World" type of script. To now being able to effortlessly create complex programs that can achieve the tasks I need to do when it comes to Game Modding. From more "simple" CLI programs, to heavily complex GUI programs that required a lot of code.</p>
        <p>One of the biggest hurdles I had to overcome was learning GUI programming in Python and god, did it fucking suck. This is a language that well and truly is not designed for this kind of work, but, it was the only way I knew to properly achieve what I wanted to do. As learning another language, such as C++ would've been a bit out of the scope of things. But, having all things said and done, it's given me skills I wouldn't have exactly had prior, and the rather fast development of the "GUI" tool, is evident of this. Going from a very simple and basic prototype, to a fully functioning, multi-threaded program within the matter of a few days. All of this, however, began with what was effectively me getting distracted with something. I was bored, ended up falling into this rabbit hole and it all began with making a simple tool to create audio files for this game.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, though, this project of mine allowed me to learn some pretty cool things, not only have I improved at coding, I also learned some more website creation skills as well, which is, quite literally, evident with the page you're reading right now. No wordpress templates here, this is coded with blood, sweat, tears and love by yours truly. As a testiment to the spirit of this project, I decided it was appropriate. (Though... having no WYSIWYG editor makes spell checking impossible, as I am writing this all in a fucking IDE, which is, well, for coding, not "effortlessly designing a website".) </p>
      <h2>Production Skills</h2>
        <p>To be filled.</p>
      <h2>Reflection.</h2>
        <p>There's a lot to reflect on here, especially in terms of what could've been and what I could've done better.</p>
        <p>Initially, I was planning to do something entirely different to this, my plan, at first, was a pop-up theatre kind of 3D Animation, you may be wondering, that's a pretty significant change compared to what I did today. And that's for a few reasons: Firstly, Game Modding is already something I do from time to time. Secondly, due to arguably insanely poor time management, I had gotten hyper-fixated on Taiko, during the initial planning phases of our FMP. Casuing me to end up focusing on this, instead of developing that Initial proposal I had made. However, I do think this worked out for the better, as I get to work on something I am a lot more passionate about, which is, Game Modding and making, what are effectively, YouTube styled videos. The kind of content I already love to consume and create.</p>
        <p> </p>
        <p>On that note of poor time management skills, in both my initial plans and this current one I went through with, there things I think I flew a bit too close to the sun with. Setting my own expectations of quality high ultimately led me to being in the wrong sort of headspace for this, procrastinating a lot and working on other, unrelated things instead of persuing this. Ironically, once I decided to link my game-modding work back round to my college work, my motivation to even do it at all plumeted. This is something I have to work on in the future, as it's becoming a significant struggle now as it is.</p>
